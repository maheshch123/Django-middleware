Writing a custom Middleware :
In very simple terms, it is much like a view function.
The only thing we need to care about is that there are 2 hooks available for request and 3 for a response.
Your Middleware class should define at least one of the following methods:
Called during request:
process_request(request)
process_view(request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs)
Called during response:
process_exception(request, exception) (only if the view raised an exception)
process_template_response(request, response) (only for template responses)
process_response(request, response)
